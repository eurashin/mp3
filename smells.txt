1) Smell: Duplicated Code (appears twice in the same class)
   Refactoring: Extract Method (place calls for new method in both places)
2) Smell: Feature Envy (code should be in another class) 
   Refactoring: Move Method (method should be moved) 
3) We can fix this code by adding a loop to repeat these statements.
